# SASS-Code-Example-Demo
This is a project to be used as a live demo of SASS during my presentation of Less &amp; SASS.

#Setup
1. Download and install NodeJS from https://nodejs.org/en/ (Make sure "Add to PATH" is selected in installation).
2. Open up PowerShell or command prompt and go to the root folder of this project (where this readme-file is located).
3. Type "npm install -g gulp" to install GULP globally on your computer.
4. Type "npm install" and all packages in packages.json will be installed.
5. Type "gulp" and GULP starts listening to changes in assets/sass folder.
